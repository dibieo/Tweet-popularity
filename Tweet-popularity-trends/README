This project is intended to demonstrate how carrot2's JAVA clustering API works

The main file is ClusteringDocumentList.java
It is located in the package org.carrot2.examples.clustering.

It includes 20 tweets that are clustered into 9 clusters
Each tweet is passed in as an org.carrot2.Document object with 3 params:
Tweet id, tweet, geo-tag.
The geo-tag param is optional right now.

For example a tweet "I love CU Boulder" with geo-tag "180 360" could be clustered as:
Document("1", "I love CU Boulder", "180 360"
